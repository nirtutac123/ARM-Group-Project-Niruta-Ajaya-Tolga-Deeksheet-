# ARM Group Project - Supply Chain Disruption Prediction

## Project Title
**Predicting Supply Chain Disruptions in the Manufacturing Industry Using Machine Learning**

This is the public repository for our 1st semester group project of Advanced Research Methodologies. This repo contains all the necessary files for the coding phase of our final project focused on using machine learning to predict and prevent supply chain disruptions in pharmaceutical manufacturing.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes 9+ years of pharmaceutical supply chain data to build predictive models that can forecast delivery delays and identify potential disruptions before they occur, enabling proactive supply chain management.
